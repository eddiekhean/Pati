                        <p>"Your nutrition plays a powerful role in your appearance. If your body is missing key
                            vitamins and nutrients, it can't process fat and upkeep healthy connective tissue, which is
                            why unprocessed fat flows up and starts pushing up against your skin, forming bumps you know
                            as cellulite.</p>
