                    <p>Lymphatic drops have poor bioavailability—liquid ingredients pass through your digestive system
                        too quickly to be properly absorbed. Most contain only milligrams of herbs (symbolic amounts,
                        not therapeutic doses) and act as basic diuretics that pull water from your bloodstream, not
                        from tissue swelling.</p>
                    <p>Sculptique uses capsules with therapeutic doses (100-500mg per ingredient) that are properly
                        absorbed and work at the cellular level to restore vessel function, break down protein clogs,
                        and strengthen vessel walls—not just make you urinate more.</p>

                    <p>Your diet only addressed what goes INTO your system (inflammation from food). It didn't fix your
                        body's broken ability to drain what's already there. That's why you could eat perfectly clean
                        and still wake up bloated—the backed-up lymphatic waste was still pooling in your tissues.</p>
